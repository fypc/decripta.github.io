U.S. European officials broach topic of peace negociations with Ukraine, source say. The conversations have included very broad outlines of what Ukraine might need to give up to reach a deal with Russia.


They began amid concerns among U.S. and European officials that the war has reached a stalemate and about the ability to continue providing aid to Ukraine, officials said. Biden administration officials also worried that Ukraine is running out of forces, while Russia has a seemingly endless supply, officials said. Ukraine is also struggling with recruiting and has recently seen public protests about some of President Volodymyr Zelensky's open-ended conscription requirements.
